# i need AGI lol

the greatest achievers in history often found a path of actions that resulted in successfully solving a problem some couldn't even ascribe variables to.

they built algorithms using knowledge/data + experience + logic + creativity + feasability/practicality.

the current state of machine/deep learning problem solving abilities est merde.

that's why the best you can get is access to humans who have(/have had) what you want, as they are currently the best AGI models for that purpose.

the second best thing for fast answers? search engines and other people looking for the same answer.

## sources of knowledge

1. Public:
   - web crawlable data (api + domain non-gated content like youtube/stackoverflow)
   - online/in-person communities/events (hackathons, bootcamps, DAOs, X communities, nomads.com, indiehackers, meetup, ... )

2. Private:
   - niche digital communities (discord, telegram, patreon, ...)
   - copyrighted content (books, videos, courses, ...)
   - specialized tutoring/coaching/servicing (including marketplace mentoring like *insert_the_PT_one)
   - personal network / team
   - targeted outreach

## web crawlable data

you gotta master the art of googling as it can reduce external dependency.

top 3 tips are:
1. use incognito/other browser search
2. use operators (commands for google.com/advanced_search)
3. job is to find the source answer, not confirmation nor denial
4. consider google lens/scholar/patents/...

> these can be used anywhere in the search terms, doesn’t have to be used in the full keyword. can include multiple operators

- {“XY”} forces exact match results including order of keywords
    - good for {low tax jurisdictions “settee.io”}
    - good for uncommon spellings/unpopular terms/…
- {X -Y} excludes after minus and like all others, can be used multiple times in the same search
    - could find unsecure pages with -https also using the site: operator
- {X * Y} is used to replace terms i don’t know/have/want the words for
- {X AROUND(number) Y} shows results where both terms are used within X number of words in sentences
- {XY before/after:yyyy-mm-dd} mm-dd is optional
- {X..Y} will show anything from range X to Y - works for dates, titles, anything
    - e.g. “5..7 facts about nomads” shows pages with exact sentence 5/6/7 facts about nomads
- {X site:Y.com} Y is optional, i could just search tld .com if i didn’t want .org/…
- {X ext:filetype} does not work for mp3
- {X loc:location}
- {cache:XY.com} is a wayback machine in case it goes down
- { (X OR/| Y OR Z OR W) } good for when a topic has synonyms or different names
- {X AND/&& Y} has to include both
    - combining AND + OR would work like maths : e.g. python AND (js OR node) would output python + js OR python + node
- {X intitle/inurl/intext/inanchor:Y} if allin… is used, it includes all terms like with exact match
    - i could actually use this to search for mp3s that don’t work on the ext: operator
- {related:XY.com} finds similar websites
- {X in Y} converts numbers and languages
- {$X Y} gives me Y at X dollars - can also use range operator ofc
- {@XY} finds social medias
